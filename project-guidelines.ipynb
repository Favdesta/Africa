    "# Course project guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment for the course project is to formulate and answer a question of your choosing based on one of the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ClimateWatch historical emissions data: greenhouse gas emissions by U.S. state 1990-present\n",
    "2. World Happiness Report 2023: indices related to happiness and wellbeing by country 2008-present\n",
    "3. Any dataset from the class assignments or mini projects\n",
    "\n",
    "A good question is one that you want to answer. It should be a question with contextual meaning, not a purely technical matter. It should be clear enough to answer, but not so specific or narrow that your analysis is a single line of code. It should require you to do some nontrivial exploratory analysis, descriptive analysis, and possibly some statistical modeling. You aren't required to use any specific methods, but it should take a bit of work to answer the question. There may be multiple answers or approaches to contrast based on different ways of interpreting the question or different ways of analyzing the data. If your question is answerable in under 15 minutes, or your answer only takes a few sentences to explain, the question probably isn't nuanced enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare and submit a jupyter notebook that summarizes your work. Your notebook should contain the following sections/contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data description**: write up a short summary of the dataset you chose to work with following the conventions introduced in previous assignments. Cover the sampling if applicable and data semantics, but focus on providing high-level context and not technical details; don't report preprocessing steps or describe tabular layouts, etc.\n",
    "* **Question of interest**: motivate and formulate your question; explain what a satisfactory answer might look like.\n",
    "* **Data analysis**: provide a walkthrough with commentary of the steps you took to investigate and answer the question. This section can and should include code cells and text cells, but you should try to focus on presenting the analysis clearly by organizing cells according to the high-level steps in your analysis so that it is easy to skim. For example, if you fit a regression model, include formulating the explanatory variable matrix and response, fitting the model, extracting coefficients, and perhaps even visualization all in one cell; don't separate these into 5-6 substeps.\n",
    "* **Summary of findings**: answer your question by interpreting the results of your analysis, referring back as appropriate. This can be a short paragraph or a bulleted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will be evaluated on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Thoughtfulness: does your question reflect some thoughtful consideration of the dataset and its nuances, or is it more superficial?\n",
    "2. Thoroughness: is your analysis an end-to-end exploration, or are there a lot of loose ends or unexplained choices?\n",
    "3. Mistakes or oversights: is your work free from obvious errors or omissions, or are there mistakes and things you've overlooked?\n",
    "4. Clarity of write-up: is your report well-organized with commented codes and clear writing, or does it require substantial effort to follow?"

    "Many people outside of Africa often hold misconceptions about the happiness of its people, largely influenced by the limited and often negative portrayal of the continent in the media. News reports tend to focus on conflicts, poverty, and other challenges faced by some African nations, creating a distorted perception that everyone in Africa is unhappy. However, it is crucial to recognize that Africa is a vast and diverse continent with 54 countries, each with its own unique experiences and stories. While corruption and the lingering effects of colonialism have undoubtedly presented obstacles for the African continent, it is important to acknowledge the resilience and strength of African communities. Close-knit family units and strong community bonds are prevalent across the continent, fostering support and happiness among individuals. Furthermore, Africa's wealth is growing at a significant pace, with several countries experiencing notable economic progress. Among the top five countries with growing GDP in Africa are Seychelles, Maurituis, Libya, South Africa, and Gabon signaling positive trends in economic development for future generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to economic growth, there are African countries that have stable governments and populations living relatively happy lives. While happiness is a subjective measure, certain countries stand out in terms of their efforts to improve the quality of life for their people. These countries include Mauritius, Algeria, South Africa, Congo, and Guinea. These nations have made strides in governance stability, promoting social welfare, and creating opportunities for their citizens. However, it is important to note that happiness and stability can vary across regions within these countries, and there are still ongoing challenges to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my evaluation, I will consider the impact of corruption, freedom, GDP, life expectancy, and generosity with the level of happiness. I will also examine the resilience and strength of family structures and community bonds. Additionally, I will analyze the generational changes taking place and the efforts made by African countries to improve the overall quality of life for their people. By taking a holistic approach, considering various factors and perspectives, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the happiness and well-being of people across different African countries.\n"

    "Upon analyzing the data provided, it is evident that Africa ranks lower in several metrics related to happiness and well-being. Particularly, Africa demonstrates higher perceptions of corruption, lower social support, and relatively lower levels of positive affect compared to other continents. This information sheds light on a concerning pattern where Africa tends to be at the forefront in negative aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is crucial to recognize the broader context surrounding Africa's challenges. The continent is endowed with abundant natural resources and boasts a rapidly growing population. Yet, it has faced a series of devastating events, including colonization, political instabilities, conflicts, and economic exploitation throughout its history. These factors have undoubtedly shaped the socio-economic landscape of African countries, impacting various aspects of life, including happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of Africa's unique historical and socio-economic circumstances, it is important to exercise caution when comparing African countries with other continents that have historically exploited the continent and its resources. Such comparisons may not fully capture the complexities and nuances of Africa's journey towards improving the well-being of its people. Therefore, focusing on Africa as a distinct entity and analyzing the happiness levels within the continent itself could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the specific challenges and progress experienced by African countries alone."

    "The data shows, the top five countries with higher happiness levels in Africa are Mauritius, Libya, Algeria, Somalia, and Morocco. The bottom three countries with relatively lower happiness levels are Burundi, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. While it is essential to consider a range of factors influencing happiness, here are some possible reasons for the happiness levels observed in these countries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Top Five Countries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mauritius: Mauritius has consistently ranked high in happiness due to factors such as political stability, strong social cohesion, effective governance, and a thriving tourism industry. The economy, quality education, and good healthcare infrastructure also contribute to the overall well-being of its citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Libya: Despite its challenges, Libya's higher happiness levels might be attributed to factors such as a rich cultural heritage, strong social networks, and a sense of unity among its people. The country's vast natural resources and potential for economic development may also contribute to positive outlooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Algeria: Algeria's higher happiness levels could be linked to its relatively stable political environment, social support networks, and access to public services. The country's economic growth, driven by the oil and gas industry, has contributed to improving living conditions and overall satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Somalia: Despite ongoing conflicts and challenges, Somalia's higher happiness levels could be associated with factors like resilience, community support systems, and cultural cohesion. Despite hardships, individuals in Somalia may find happiness in strong familial bonds, traditional values, and a sense of identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Morocco: Morocco's higher happiness levels can be attributed to several factors, including political stability, strong cultural identity, improved living standards, and a growing tourism industry. The government's investments in social development, education, and infrastructure have positively impacted citizens' well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom Three Countries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Burundi: Burundi's lower happiness levels may stem from factors such as political instability, widespread poverty, and limited access to basic services like healthcare and education. Ongoing conflicts and economic challenges contribute to a less favorable environment for happiness and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Central African Republic: The Central African Republic faces significant challenges related to ongoing conflicts, political instability, and weak infrastructure. These factors, coupled with high poverty rates, limited access to education and healthcare, and social unrest, contribute to lower happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. South Sudan: South Sudan's lower happiness levels are primarily influenced by the impacts of prolonged conflicts(speration from Sudan), displacement, food insecurity, and economic instability. The lack of basic services, weak governance, and limited social cohesion contribute to a challenging environment for happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that these observations are based on the data provided, and it's crucial to consider other important factors such as historical, social, and economic contexts to truly grasp the happiness levels in these countries. The numbers alone may not fully capture the complex reality experienced by individuals in each country. Factors like cultural influences, societal norms, and unique historical experiences shape people's happiness in ways that data alone cannot capture. So, while the data offers valuable insights, a more complete understanding requires a deeper exploration of the rich and diverse aspects that contribute to people's happiness and well-being in these countries."

    "Continuing with the analysis, I proceeded to examine the distributions of key factors, such as GDP, freedom, social support, generosity, life expectancy, and corruption, across different subregions using boxplots. The boxplots provide valuable insights into the variations and central tendencies of these factors within each subregion. By visualizing the data in this manner, I aimed to gain a better understanding of how these factors contribute to the overall well-being and happiness levels in African sub regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplots allowed me to compare the medians, quartiles, and potential outliers for each subregion across the selected factors. This analysis helps identify any variations or discrepancies between subregions in terms of their economic development, social support systems, individual freedoms, levels of corruption, and other relevant aspects. By examining these factors on a subregional level, I could uncover nuanced patterns and potential areas for further investigation. This approach allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the diverse factors influencing happiness levels across different African subregions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the regional dynamics at play."

    "During the analysis of various factors including GDP per capita, freedom, social support, generosity, life expectancy, and corruption within different subregions of Africa, notable patterns emerged. \n",
    "\n",
    "When examining GDP per capita, the subregions displayed varying levels of economic development. North Africa emerged as the highest-ranking subregion due to its robust economies such as Algeria and Egypt, followed by Southern Africa, which includes economically prosperous countries like South Africa and Botswana. Middle Africa, Western Africa, and Eastern Africa followed suit, each with their own economic strengths driven by countries like Angola, Nigeria, and Kenya, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding freedom, Eastern Africa and Southern Africa exhibited a tie for the top position. These subregions boast relatively stable political environments, conducive to individual freedoms and democratic principles. Western Africa and North Africa secured subsequent positions due to varying degrees of political stability and social liberties. Middle Africa ranked last, as certain countries within the subregion face challenges related to political rights and civil liberties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of social support, Southern Africa emerged as the subregion with the highest levels. Countries such as Namibia and South Africa have implemented robust social welfare systems and support networks. North Africa followed suit with countries like Tunisia and Morocco prioritizing social programs. Eastern Africa demonstrated a commendable level of social support, while Western Africa and Middle Africa shared a similar ranking due to a combination of factors including resource constraints and limited access to social services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to generosity, Western Africa took the lead. The subregion is characterized by a strong sense of community and mutual assistance, evident in countries like Senegal and Nigeria. Eastern Africa followed closely, with a cultural emphasis on sharing and solidarity. North Africa, Middle Africa, and Southern Africa exhibited relatively lower levels of generosity, primarily influenced by factors such as economic disparities and cultural dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing life expectancy, Northern Africa emerged as the subregion with the highest values. The subregion benefits from well-developed healthcare systems and a focus on public health initiatives. Eastern Africa secured the second position, reflecting improvements in healthcare infrastructure and disease control programs. Western Africa, Middle Africa, and Southern Africa experienced varying life expectancy levels, influenced by factors such as access to healthcare, prevalence of diseases, and socio-economic disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining corruption, Middle Africa exhibited the highest levels. Factors such as weak governance structures and lack of transparency contribute to this ranking. Western Africa followed suit, facing similar challenges in terms of corruption. Southern Africa and Eastern Africa showed relatively lower levels of corruption, reflecting efforts to combat corrupt practices. Northern Africa ranked last in terms of corruption, with countries implementing anti-corruption measures more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide more depth to the analysis, some notable countries within each subregion include Algeria and Egypt in North Africa, South Africa and Botswana in Southern Africa, Angola and Nigeria in Western Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia in Eastern Africa, and Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon in Middle Africa. These countries exemplify the trends and dynamics observed within their respective subregions."

    "Upon analyzing the boxplots of happiness levels across subregions in Africa, the following order emerged: Northern Africa, Southern Africa, Middle Africa, Western Africa, and Eastern Africa. These findings can be compared to the previous analyses of GDP, freedom, social support, generosity, life expectancy, and corruption within each subregion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Northern Africa, the relatively higher happiness levels align with the region's stronger economic performance, characterized by countries with higher GDP per capita such as Algeria and Egypt. Additionally, Northern Africa exhibits comparatively better scores in terms of freedom, social support, generosity, life expectancy, and lower corruption levels. These factors contribute to the overall higher happiness levels observed in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Southern Africa, ranking second in happiness levels, is known for its more developed economies like South Africa and Botswana, contributing to a relatively higher GDP per capita. The region also demonstrates favorable scores in freedom, social support, generosity, and life expectancy. However, corruption levels in some countries within the region remain a challenge, potentially impacting happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle Africa, occupying the third position, experiences lower happiness levels compared to Northern and Southern Africa. This is partly attributed to lower GDP per capita and challenges related to political stability and corruption. Despite these challenges, Middle Africa exhibits moderate scores in terms of freedom, social support, generosity, and life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Western Africa follows as the fourth-ranked subregion in terms of happiness levels. It faces economic and social challenges, resulting in lower GDP per capita and relatively lower scores in freedom, social support, generosity, and life expectancy. Corruption remains a significant concern in some Western African countries, potentially influencing happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastern Africa, ranking fifth, displays lower happiness levels compared to other subregions. Economic factors, such as lower GDP per capita, alongside social and political challenges, contribute to this pattern. While Eastern Africa exhibits moderate scores in freedom, social support, and life expectancy, corruption levels and generosity scores are areas that may impact overall happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the order of happiness levels across the subregions aligns with the patterns observed in the analysis of GDP, freedom, social support, generosity, life expectancy, and corruption. These findings emphasize the interconnectedness of these factors in shaping the happiness levels within each subregion, highlighting the importance of considering multiple dimensions when examining well-being on a regional level."

    "In order to dig deeper into the data and uncover valuable insights, we decided to fit a regression model to explore how different factors relate to happiness levels across various sub-regions. We carefully crafted a matrix of explanatory variables, including indicators such as GDP per capita, freedom, social support, generosity, life expectancy, and corruption. These factors were carefully chosen as they have the potential to influence happiness. \n",
    "\n",
    "After preparing the data, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to fit the model. This approach allowed us to estimate the coefficients and understand the magnitude and direction of the relationships between the predictors and happiness levels. We made sure to handle any missing values, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the findings more accessible and visually appealing, we turned to Altair, a powerful data visualization library. With Altair, we created an insightful chart that presents the coefficients for each variable. The chart was designed in a way that highlights the most influential factors, showcasing them at the top of the chart. This visualization not only helps us understand the impact of each variable on happiness levels across the sub-regions but also enables us to easily communicate our findings in a concise and understandable manner."

    "Upon analyzing the regression model results, several key findings emerge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, GDP per capita shows a positive relationship with happiness levels, with an estimated coefficient of 0.260. This suggests that as the GDP per capita increases, happiness levels tend to rise as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, freedom appears to be a significant predictor of happiness, with a coefficient of 0.763. This implies that individuals who have more freedom in their lives are likely to experience higher levels of happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, social support exhibits a strong positive relationship with happiness, as indicated by an estimated coefficient of 1.234. This suggests that having a robust social support network contributes significantly to overall happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, generosity also emerges as a factor influencing happiness levels, with a coefficient of 1.028. This indicates that individuals who exhibit more generous behaviors may experience greater levels of happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, life expectancy shows a positive relationship with happiness, albeit with a smaller coefficient of 0.019. This implies that longer life expectancy tends to be associated with higher levels of happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, corruption appears to have a slightly negative association with happiness, with an estimated coefficient of 0.321. This suggests that higher levels of corruption in society may contribute to lower happiness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the \"Error variance\" value of 0.292 indicates the variability in happiness levels that cannot be explained by the included variables. This highlights the presence of other influential factors that were not accounted for in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to happiness levels. They suggest that economic factors, freedom, social support, generosity, life expectancy, and corruption play significant roles in shaping individual happiness."
